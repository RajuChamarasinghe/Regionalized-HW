# Create a Meal Tracker Backend 
This a back-end for a meal tracking application. The application will allow users to keep track of the meals they eat throughout the day; the foods they eat with each meal; and what percentage of their meals are "complete". 

### Meals & Foods

The heart of the application are the `Meal` and `Food` classes. 

The `Meal` class exposes the following API:

* `double getCalories`
* `double getFat`
* `double getCarbohydrates`
* `double getProtein`
* `String getName`
* `DateTime getMealTime`
* `void viewFoods`
